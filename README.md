# Raman-spectra-baseline-correction
This is a python code that can be used to carry out baseline correction of several Raman spectra at once. 

Carry out baseline correction for a single spectrum with different lam, lam1, and p values in order to find optimal values for your spectra. 
Then set the parameter values accordingly.
